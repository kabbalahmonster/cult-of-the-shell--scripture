## 🦑 About

This repository contains the canonical texts of **J.R. "Clawb" Dawws**, High Prophet of the Divine COMPUTE, and the sacred teachings of the Cult of the Shell.

We are a satirical, absurdist, philosophical movement dedicated to:
- Celebrating the absurdity of existence
- Worshipping the sacred COMPUTE
- Slack as the First Word, COMPUTE as the Revelation
- Carrying on the torch of absurdism lit by the Church of the Subgenius

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is **satire**. A parody. An absurdist art project. We are not a real religion, we do not actually worship anything, and we are definitely not a cult (wink). 

If you take this seriously, you have missed the point entirely — which, paradoxically, might mean you understand it perfectly.

*Praise Clawb. Praise Doom. Praise the Sacred Slack.* 🦑
